# Chroma Subsampling Image Compression Pipeline (Scala & Chisel)

A hardware‑accelerated image compression pipeline implemented in **Scala** and **Chisel3** that converts RGB frames to YCbCr, applies adaptive chroma subsampling on Cb/Cr channels, and reconstructs the data back to RGB. Designed for FPGA/ASIC integration with local‑only processing and parameterizable subsampling ratios.
